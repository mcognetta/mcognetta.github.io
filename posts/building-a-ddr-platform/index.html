I mainly played Jubeat, but towards the end of my time in Korea, I started playing DDR. This really picked up when I joined Google, since there was a well-maintained machine and an active community. I ended up playing basically every day while I was there.</p> <p>When COVID hit, I moved back to my parents&#39; house in Florida and decided to &quot;decorate&quot; my &quot;office&quot; with my two favorite perks from work: an espresso machine and a DDR machine. </p> <p>I got a <a href="https://www.breville.com/en-us/product/bes870">Breville Barista Express</a> &#40;50&#37; off, for some reason; between my mother&#39;s and my daily coffee, it paid for itself in like 2 months&#41; and an <a href="https://www.iamats.com/shop/dance-mat-ltek-prime/">LTEK DDR pad</a>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/ddr-pad-post/pad.jpg" alt=pad  /></p> <p>As far as hard DDR pads go, there are basically three options:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fndef:1" class=fnref >[1]</a></sup> the LTEK &#40;a good intro pad, reasonably priced&#41;, the StepManiaX pad/cab &#40;really nice, pretty expensive, perpetually sold out&#41;, and an actual DDR machine &#40;expensive, hard to find, unlikely to get past my mom; I actually found a broken one at a bowling alley in my hometown and made an offer, but they never got back to me&#41;. So for me the LTEK was a pretty good choice. I got the metal finish without the bar, and it arrived pretty quickly despite coming from Poland in the depths of COVID.</p> <p>The lack of a bar ended up being a bit of an issue. For a while, I was using the back of a chair with a towel for grip, but the chair back was the wrong height/width and very curved, so it wasn&#39;t ideal. I mainly play stamina songs &#40;longer, faster songs with more fluid rhythm rather than short bursty songs with gimmicks&#41;, so having a curved bar ended up being pretty rough on my arms.</p> <p>Coupled with my semiannual existential crisis of &quot;the stuff I work on and research is so far removed from the user that I feel like I never build anything tangible&quot;, I felt this was a good chance to try building a bar and platform for the pad. I sketched out the basic design for a platform using some DDR cab schematics that I found online &#40;for the bar dimensions/placement&#41; and my dad and I got to work.</p> <p><img src="/assets/ddr-pad-post/sketch.jpg" alt=sketch  /></p> <p>We built it out of pretty basic materials from Home Depot. Basically a bunch of 2x4s plus three steel pipes and some elbows for the bar. If I remember correctly, the bar ended up being a bit wider than a typical DDR cab, but the height was actually pretty close. The pipes were threaded, so it would have been a pain to cut them down to the correct size and we just left it.</p> <p><img src="/assets/ddr-pad-post/materials_2.jpg" alt="starting materials" /></p> <p>The general shape came together pretty fast, despite me using a handsaw for everything.</p> <p><img src="/assets/ddr-pad-post/materials_9.jpg" alt=frame  /></p> <p>We had cut a small hole in the frame to fit the USB connector for the LTEK pad.</p> <p><img src="/assets/ddr-pad-post/materials_8.jpg" alt=connector  /></p> <p>A couple of last-minute touches to secure the pad and make it look a little cleaner wrapped up the project.</p> <p><img src="/assets/ddr-pad-post/materials_11.jpg" alt="final touches" /></p> <p>And here is the final result&#33;</p> <p><img src="/assets/ddr-pad-post/materials_12.jpg" alt="final result" /></p> <table class=fndef  id="fndef:1"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:1">[1]</a> <td class=fndef-content >There is also this awesome DIY travel pad, designed by someone I used to play DDR with: <a href="https://github.com/teejusb/teejusb-pad">https://github.com/teejusb/teejusb-pad</a>. </table> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Marco Cognetta.
