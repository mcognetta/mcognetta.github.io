The scores, grandmaster commentary, and Stockfish evaluations tell most of the story, but isn't there someone you forgot to ask? <br> <br> That's right, the <a href="https://lichess.org/">Lichess</a> chess <a href="https://lichess.org/@/lichess/blog/developer-update-275-improved-game-compression/Wqa7GiAA">game compression model</a> has some key insights for us. </i></center> <br><br> <p><strong>Note</strong>: This post can also be found on <a href="https://lichess.org/@/fruitdealer2002/blog/the-lichess-game-compressors-analysis-of-game-1/X0afKqm2">Lichess</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcognetta.bsky.social/post/3lbuj5fz3gs2x">Bluesky</a>.</p> <small><small> <b>Note 2</b>: This post is satirical. I mean the numbers and stuff are real and actually drawn from the compressor, but the commentary is not. </small></small> <br> <br> <p>Trained on millions of games, the Lichess compression model converts moves to bits depending on how good they are. Pretty sure it can give Stockfish a run for its money. Let&#39;s see how accurate Gukesh and Ding were in game 1.</p> <p><img src="/assets/lichess-compressor-championship-post/game_one_index.png" alt="the rank of each move in the game according to the compressor for each player" /></p> <p>Gukesh agreed with the Lichess Compressor&#39;s best move 6 times out of 42. Ding, on the other hand, agreed just twice. A sad showing. On average, they both chose the ~11th best moves with medians of 10.5 and 8, respectively. Is this what you would expect from potential World Champions?</p> <p>In particular, the Lichess compressor noted one massive blunder by Ding: 18. ... Nb2??. This is the 47th best move out of 49 available moves in the position. Insanity. The Lichess compressor recommends the far better Nxe5&#33;&#33;.</p> <p><img src="/assets/lichess-compressor-championship-post/nb2.png" alt="the blunder 18. .. Nb2??" /></p> <p>From an entropy standpoint we see a clear difference in play. The Lichess compressor uses an average of ~4.4 bits per move for encoding. Gukesh and Ding required an average of 4.98 and 5.21 bits, respectively, indicating that they deviated significantly from established thought.</p> <p><img src="/assets/lichess-compressor-championship-post/game_one_bits.png" alt="the number of bits required to encode each move in the game according to the compressor for each player" /></p> <p>Gukesh required 209 bits to encode his moves while Ding required a whopping 219&#33; Of that, an enormous 14 bits were needed for his catastrophic Nb2?? blunder. That&#39;s more than 6&#37; of the encoding&#33;</p> <p>We should all pray for Lichess and whoever is covering their storage costs if this is the future of chess.</p> <p>On an unrelated note, I once made a Lichess bot that used the compression function as an evaluation function. It didn&#39;t win a single game.</p> <h1 id=appendix ><a href="#appendix" class=header-anchor >Appendix</a></h1> <p>If you are interested in producing your own graphs like the ones in this article, here is a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H9cw_o-e3aLgKpwcfzzI3P4l8tkgkhPR?usp&#61;sharing">colab</a> that can convert a PGN input or a Lichess game into a graph.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Marco Cognetta.
