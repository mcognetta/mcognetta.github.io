## about me

I am currently a PhD student in NLP in the [Okazaki Lab](https://www.nlp.c.titech.ac.jp/index.en.html) at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, and a PhD Student researcher at Google Tokyo on the Gboard team. Prior to this, I was a software engineer at Google, also on Gboard. I did my MS in Computer Science at Yonsei University and my BS in Discrete Mathematics with a minor in Korean at Georgia Tech.

I am always open to chatting about interesting topics. Please feel free to send me an email ([lastname].[firstname]@gmail.com).

I am (not exhaustively) interested in:
  * Automata Theory
  * Scientific Computing
  * Languages (especially Korean and Esperanto)
  * Combinatorics
  * Open Source Software
  * High School Level Computer Science Education

## 자기소개

저는 도쿄공업대학(Tokyo Institute of Technology)의 [Okazaki 연구실](https://www.nlp.c.titech.ac.jp/index.en.html)의 박사하정 학생이고 구글 지보드(Gboard)팀의 개발자 마르코입니다. 조지아텍에서 이산수학을 전공, 한국어를 부전공하였고 이후에 연세대학교의 [계산이론 연구실](https://toc.yonsei.ac.kr/)에서 컴퓨터 과학 석사학위를 완료하였습니다.

흥미로운 주제가 있다면, 언제든 누구와도 이야기 나누고 싶습니다. 이메일로 연락해주세요 ([성].[이름]@gmail.com).

제가 특히 좋아하는 주제들은 다음과 같습니다:
  * 오토마타 이론
  * 수치해석학
  * 언어 (특히 한국어하고 에스페란토)
  * 조합론
  * 오픈소스 소프트웨어
  * 고등학교 수준의 컴퓨터과학교육

모든 게시물은 주로 영어를 사용해서 쓰고 있지만, 한국어를 연습하기 위해서 가끔 한글 게시물을 작성하거나  영어 게시물들을 한국어로 번역해서 올리고 있습니다.
