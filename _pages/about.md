I am currently a graduate student at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea studying Formal Language and Automata Theory. My main focus is on Probabilistic Finite Automata and the discriptional complexity of finite automata. I am also interested in Scientific Computing, Computer Algebra, Computational Geometry, and Complexity Theory.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Discrete Mathematics from Georiga Tech, where my undergrad thesis was on Automatic Differentiation using Straight Line Programs. I now study in the Theory of Computation lab at Yonsei University.
